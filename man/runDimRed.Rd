\title{Wrapper function to produce a pretty dimensionality reduction plot}
\usage{
runDimRed(object, clustering, type = "TSNE", downsample = 500)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A `SingleCellExperiment` instance. Must have 2D dimensionality
reduced coordinates precomputed, which can be checked with
`reducedDimNames(object)`.}

\item{clustering}{A `character vector` indicating the categorical variable
that is used to color the dimensionality reduction plot. Must be one of
`colnames(colData(object))`.}

\item{type}{A `character vector` indicating which dimensionality reduction
method should be used for visualization. Must be one of
`reducedDimNames(object)`. Defaults to "TSNE".}

\item{downsample}{Should there be a downsampling of the number of cells per
cluster in the plot? Either `logical` FALSE if no downsampling is desired
or a `numeric` indicating the maximum number of cells per cluster.}
}
\value{
Prints the dimensionality reduced plot directly to console.
